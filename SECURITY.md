# Security Policy

## Security Overview

The Email Scraping Chrome Extension is designed with security as a top priority. This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect users and ensure ethical email extraction.

## Security Features

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implemented strict CSP in `manifest.json`
- Prevents XSS attacks by restricting script sources
- Only allows scripts from the extension itself

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization
- All email addresses are validated using comprehensive regex patterns
- Input sanitization removes potential XSS vectors
- HTML tags and script content are stripped from extracted emails
- Length limits prevent buffer overflow attacks

### 3. Privacy Protection
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- All processing happens locally in the browser
- User data is stored only in Chrome's local storage
- Extension respects website terms of service

### 4. Safe DOM Manipulation
- Sensitive elements (password fields, forms, iframes) are avoided
- Text content is safely extracted with length limits
- Error handling prevents crashes from malformed DOM elements

### 5. Permission Management
- Minimal required permissions in `manifest.json`
- `activeTab` permission for current tab access only
- `storage` permission for local data storage
- `downloads` permission for export functionality

### 6. Message Validation
- Background script validates all incoming messages
- Only accepts messages from the extension itself
- Input validation for all message parameters

### 7. Data Limits
- Maximum of 500 emails per extraction to prevent performance issues
- Automatic cleanup of old data
- Duplicate prevention to avoid data bloat

## Security Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Secure coding practices following OWASP guidelines
- Regular code reviews and testing

### Data Handling
- Emails are validated before storage
- Sensitive information is never logged
- Data is encrypted in Chrome's secure storage
- Automatic data cleanup prevents accumulation

### Network Security
- No external API calls
- No data transmission to third parties
- All operations are performed locally
